# NOTES

Deleted all previous text that was in here - and added a new branch called "new_branch" using the desktop app.

Then I clicked on 'commit' for that (new) branch, and then on the button labeled 'Publish' - which created the branch online.

It looks like all of the 'merging' happens on the github site.  I am sure there is a manual way to do it, but this is probably best.  Once a merge has been performed, it brings up a box saying 'delete branch' (which as the name suggests deletes the branch.  One thing I noticed though is that the old branch seems to still exist on the desktop version.
