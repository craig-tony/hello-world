# NOTES

Adding in a notes file - not sure if this will appear in the branch or the main repo...

Just checked online, and after syncing, it was NOT in the master branch, but WAS in the readme-edits branch.  So it seems to be working. 

NOW - I will merge all changes (I will see if I can do this from the github desktop - which would be best....)
