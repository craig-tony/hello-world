# NOTES

Deleted all previous text that was in here - and added a new branch called "new_branch" using the desktop app.

Then I clicked on 'commit' for that (new) branch, and then on the button labeled 'Publish' - which created the branch online.

It looks like all of the 'merging' happens on the github site.  I am sure there is a manual way to do it, but this is probably best.  Once a merge has been performed, it brings up a box saying 'delete branch' (which as the name suggests deletes the branch.  One thing I noticed though is that the old branch seems to still exist on the desktop version.

Ok - I have now created "create_branch_online" and it seems to have appeared in the desktop app.  I am starting to get the idea now - the issue is simply which branch one commits to.  I guess if I were to always make sure to commit to a branch (called something like "development"), this might work.  I could even use this for writing papers I suppose (e.g. a branch for writing each section?).

Have now edited the text directly in sublime-text.  Will now press save to see what happens. Basically it appeared as a change.  No surprise there.
